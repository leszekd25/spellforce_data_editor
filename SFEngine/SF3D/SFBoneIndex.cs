/*
 * SFBoneIndex is a resource which contains info for skin
 * GPU is limited in that it has to know how much data it has to load - meaning you can't load dynamic arrays of matrices, for example
 * Skeletons are just that - they're dynamic in size
 * To overcome this issue, Spellforce splits its animated models into parts, each of which is animated by at most 20 bones
 * SFBoneIndex contains info on which part is animated by which bones of supplied skeleton, and  in which order the bones are
 * Technically, SFBoneIndex didn't have to be a resource, it's one purely for convenience
