# SpellforceDataEditor with viewer
would be a fitting name for this branch before i added more features, like script builder or mod manager. Now it's more like All-in-one Spellforce Modding Toolbox. It's got many useful features, most of which are described in a [slowly expanding wiki](https://github.com/leszekd25/spellforce_data_editor/wiki). Short outline here:

# GameData Editor
Allows browsing and editing Spellforce's CFF gamedata files. This file includes info such as in-game text (in many supported languages), spell/unit/item data, and more.

# Asset Viewer
This tool enables browsing all game assets (3D models, animations, sounds and music) found in game PAK files. It requires preloading data first, which might take a short while, but it's a one time requirement.

# SQL Editor
Here you can edit many of the SQL scripts in the game, useful for modding. Also here you have access to Lua decompiler for the game's many compiled Lua scripts. Still working on it!

# Mod Manager
This feature is currently in development. It allows creating and managing mods in an intuitive way.

# Map Editor
Most of the features are now complete (but might be buggy), including: creating/loading/saving maps, heightmap editing, texture editing, unit/object/building placement and editing, miscellaneous objects editing, NPC placement and editing, metadata editing

# How to use
To use the application, simply unzip it wherever you feel like.
